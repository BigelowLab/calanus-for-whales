NOTES:

EcoMon —

Runge data —

- Outliers in longitude column
	- Most are negative but then there are 2 positive 40s throwing things off
	- Mistake?

V0.0.0

- CHL, BOTT, SST, and BAT
- BRTs and GAMs
- Predictions are too high and don't line up with actual data very well
- RMSE around 2.9

V0.0.1

- CHL, BOTT, SST, BAT, and interaction between BOTT and SST
- Captured interaction using a tensor (mgcv::ti())
- Predictions are too high, still doesn't line up perfectly with actual data
- RMSE around 2.6

V0.0.2

- CHL, wind, SST, SSS, uv

V0.0.3

- Lagged sst (1 month), chl, sss, uv, wind
- Plotted points over predictions, line up well
- high abundances in all months so doesn't catch seasonality
- Some months don't have low abundance data so model doesn't know what unsuitable habitat looks like

V0.0.4

- Zeroed out covariates below 1000m

V0.0.5

- Incorporate data from NOAA COPEPOD database
- lagged SST, wind, sss, logged chl
