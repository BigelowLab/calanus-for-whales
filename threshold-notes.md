### Notes on a calculation for the threshold

We're working in Ϙ/m2 for now, so if we're starting from a measurement reported in those units, we're all set. But if they're reported in Ϙ/m3, we need to think about a conversion.

If the Ϙ were all distributed evenly throughout the water column, we could just use the water depth (d):

  Ϙ/m2 = d * Ϙ/m3

Depending on how the sampling was done, this could give a very high Ϙ/m2 value. In most cases, the Ϙ are concentrated into a layer. So if d_l is the thickness of that layer, we would just use this as a conversion:

  Ϙ/m2 = d_l * Ϙ/m3

The question is, how thick is that layer? There are some profiles in the Runge, Jones, et al. report from the Gulf of Maine where we can estimate layer thickness. It might be worth checking out [Krumhansl 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661117303270) as well. 

So to take an example, Mayo and Marx (1990) show a threshold that's around 1,000 Ϙ/m3, based on towing right behind the whale. 
If the concentration were like that for the entire depth of the water column--I think it was about 40 m--then a vertical tow would measure 40,000 Ϙ/m2.
But it was a much thinner surface layer (pers. comm.), so let's say a 10m thick layer. Then we're looking at a threshold of 10,000 Ϙ/m2. 

Estimating a max and min layer thickness will give us an upper and lower bound for the threshold. 

In the literature review, it looks like numbers are pretty much always reported in Ϙ/m3. Let's start by making a histogram of those numbers. 
Then we can do upper/lower bound estimates from there.
